### Creating a Hello World application for Android

1. Created a project in `\2_do_4\experiments\yjohnson\demo1_android`.
    * This project targets Android 11 and was initialized with the `Empty Activity` preset.

2. Performed an initial run of the raw test application using Android Debugging Bridge to my personal phone.
    * Without any modifications to the code, the following is generated onto the device:

3. This does not have much to it seeing as the activity was already pre-made to show "Hello World". Because of that,
   I'll do some transformations to see what we can get out of it.
