**S E 309 Minutes**

**2\_DO\_4** (Present: Molly, Josh, Nick, Yadiel)

**9/8/2021 @ 10:55am**

*Our goal for this meeting was to lay out what we want to achieve by the end of this semester and to have a general idea of what we should prioritize and look forward to implementing.*

Yadiel guided the team towards clear objectives of progress throughout the meeting, starting with defining the project’s “problem” and “definition” statements. As a group, we discussed the scope of intended users that this service/application would target. Molly stated that her initial vision for the application was to make it ISU-centric (hence the working title CyBuds) while Josh proposed that we could target a wider range of groups by making it possible to use it in any university. Yadiel and Nick agreed that starting with Molly’s idea was probably more feasible as an initial goal, but that theoretically it wouldn’t be impossible to expand on it, time permitting. 

Then, discussion moved toward the application’s identity: was it a discovery platform first, social media platform second, or vice versa? Molly stated that the more complex areas of the project were likely to be in the discovery aspect, and Nick added to her argument by detailing what different challenges we would face. The group unanimously agreed that we should focus on peer discovery first, and that social features (such as chat or image sharing) would have less priority.

The group, namely Nick and Josh, led the group through a discussion focused on how we should match people and what UX elements we could consider. The group settled on categories and “tags” as the best method of organizing user interests and as the method to best match them. Molly suggested a “percent match” system for matching users together while Josh suggested a tile-based UI to be used at sign up.

Technologies to be used have mostly remained the same, though notably the group dismissed the idea of branching past Android Studio’s UI framework. There was a brief discussion between Nick and Yadiel regarding the Android SDK.

Nick talked momentarily about secure sign-in and encryption, but Yadiel said that it is slightly out of scope at the moment. Yadiel also briefly mentioned possibly using the ISU directory but later dismissed the idea. Meanwhile, Nick and Josh discussed user accounts and hierarchies of power, and the topic of conversation slightly derailed to “promoted” users.

Near the end of the meeting, two major decisions were carried out: what was going to be the group’s two-week milestone, and what should each member specialize on doing. The milestone the group decided on was to get user profiles up and running, both in frontend and backend, utilizing HTTP requests and databases. Importantly, Josh and Yadiel shared differing viewpoints on how to assign responsibilities. Yadiel suggested that we could be more efficient working in our own areas, where Josh countered that it was a much better learning experience to have everyone do a bit of everything. Each of the group’s members expressed interest in working in all areas of the project, Yadiel included, and ultimately decided that it was the best course of action. However, due to the barrier of entry for such a project, Yadiel’s initial suggestion of splitting up into parts was agreed on for the first milestone. As such, every member was assigned a task: learn enough about the assigned topic to properly implement it. 

Soon thereafter, the meeting was adjourned at 11:45am.


**Written points of interest:**

Updated problem and description:

- This application is designed to connect people with each other based on how much in common they have; focused on Iowa State University. The application is focused on finding peers with similar interests while also being a pseudo-social platform. As such, the interest-matching part of the application is priority. Categorizing interest and cataloguing user preferences will allow for matching, while profiles will allow for users to determine if they want to complete the match or not.

Elements necessary for Milestone 1:

- Frontend Elements
  - Main Menu 
  - Sign up page
  - Account page 
- Backend Elements
  - Server and client codes
  - Database for users

Group member assignments (for now):

- Molly: HTTP requests
- Josh: Frontend UI, for user profiles and signup
- Nick: Spring Boot server to interface with frontend and SQL
- Johnson: SQL database
